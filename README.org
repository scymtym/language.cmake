* Introduction

  This system implements most of the [[https://cmake.org][CMake]] language and some parts of
  the associated standard library.

  Why this project? This system is not intended (and cannot be used)
  as a replacement for the original CMake software package. Instead,
  it is intended for simulated execution and analysis of CMake
  programs in order to answer questions such as "Which CMake packages,
  pkg-config modules and programs are required to build this CMake
  project?".
